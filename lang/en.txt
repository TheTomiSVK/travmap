help1=Separate multiple alliances and players with commas; quotes can be used to keep commas and spaces intact, eg -- A, B, "C,D,E", F
help2=Zoom = "x,y,zoom factor" or "village name,zoom factor"
help3=Alliance, player, and town to zoom in on are all case sensetive, as it makes things a *LOT* faster
help4=Players and alliances with non-standard characters in their names can use their IDs rather than their names, eg "id:123"
help5=Hotlinking is encouraged -- while each map takes a while to be generated the first time each day, it's then cached, and takes practically no processing power or bandwidth to re-send.
