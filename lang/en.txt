help1=Separate multiple alliances and players with commas; quotes can be used to keep commas and spaces intact, eg -- <code>A, B, "C,D,E", F</code>
help2=Zoom = <code>x,y,zoom factor</code> or <code>village name,zoom factor</code>
help3=Alliance, player, and town to zoom in on are all case sensetive, as it makes things a *LOT* faster
help4=Players and alliances with non-standard characters in their names can use their IDs rather than their names, eg <code>id:123</code>
