help1=Separate multiple alliances and players with commas; quotes can be used to keep commas and spaces intact, eg -- A, B, "C,D,E", F
help2=Zoom = "x,y,zoom factor" or "village name,zoom factor"
help3=Alliance, player, and town to zoom in on are all case sensetive, as it makes things a *LOT* faster
help4=Players and alliances with non-standard characters in their names can use their IDs rather than their names, eg "id:123"

notice=Sorry for the downtime, I'm self-hosted and my modem broke while I was out... Seeing as this service is eating a load of <a href="http://shish.is-a-geek.net/misc/stats/graphs/allcpu.php?rrd=aru&time=year">CPU time</a> (being jammed at 100% for the most popular hour, it's slowed down so much I added a "loading" screen...), and uses such big databases it's killing the disks (note <a href="http://shish.is-a-geek.net/misc/stats/history.php?rrd=aru_travmap&function=range">load times</a> -- any time over 5 seconds normally means that several requests are fighting over the disk at once). With growth <a href="http://shish.is-a-geek.net/misc/stats/history.php?rrd=browsers_travmap&function=browser">showing no sign of slowing down</a>, I'm seriously considering buying external hosting (dreamhost look best so far); however that's expensive for someone with no job (full time education...). Hence, I'm also planning on adding an advertisement or something in this space (ie, the help space, which is hidden once a map is viewed. Using google ads, unless someone suggests better). Any questions / comments / generous donations appreicated ;) -- <a href="mailto:webmaster@shish.is-a-geek.net">webmaster@shish.is-a-geek.net</a>
