help1=Separate multiple alliances and players with commas; quotes can be used to keep commas and spaces intact, eg -- A, B, "C,D,E", F
help2=Zoom = "x,y,zoom factor" or "village name,zoom factor"
help3=Alliance, player, and town to zoom in on are all case sensetive, as it makes things a *LOT* faster
help4=Players and alliances with non-standard characters in their names can use their IDs rather than their names, eg "id:123"
help5=Hotlinking is encouraged -- while each map takes a while to be generated the first time each day, it's then cached, and takes practically no processing power or bandwidth to re-send.

notice=Bah, I've ended up getting a full domain for my projects, and I tire of moving -- this will be the place for the forseeable future :P <p>Trying to lessen the server load I now have two layers of caching -- requesting <i>exactly</i> the same map twice should just send the pre-drawn copy, but now data itself is cached, so when two maps use the same data (ie, the only difference is visual, eg one has lines turned on and one doesn't), it should use the cached data. This is *very* experimental though...
